The **Unigraph Chrome Extension** enables users to **save, annotate, and structure information across the internet**—including pages, text, images, videos, audio, and other formats **into a personal knowledge graph**.

This tool transforms the browser into a knowledge-gathering interface, where any online content can be captured, enriched with context, and linked to existing entities in the user's Unigraph system.

#### **Core Value Proposition**

The Unigraph Chrome Extension turns the web into a canvas for building your own structural and semantic layers of understanding.

1. **Cross-Platform Annotation Layer**  
   Capture and annotate content from any website—text, media, or other data—using a unified schema that transcends individual apps. Unigraph serves as a general-purpose annotation system across the entire internet.
2. **Consolidation into a Computable Graph**  
   Once in Unigraph, it is part of a structured, queryable, and extensible knowledge graph in a powerful application ecosystem. This isn't just storage—it’s a **representation language** for encoding meaning, and environment for working with it.
3. **Programmable and Shareable Intelligence**  
   With built-in support for type systems and Copilot-like tools, you can write programs that run over your graph, automate workflows, or share custom views and logic with others. Your knowledge graph becomes a living system you can compute on.

#### **Example Use Cases**

**Basic**

- Annotating academic papers and linking them to your research topics.
- Capturing quotes and insights from news articles into argument maps or debates.
- Bookmarking GitHub issues or StackOverflow answers with rich metadata for future references.

**More Advanced User Journeys**

- I am reading about famous mathematicians on Wikipedia, and curious to what extent two individuals worked together. Using the Unigraph Chrome Extension (UCE), I can select both person's wikipedia pages, and send a request to Unigraph to do various actions on these peoples, including

  - 1.  Creating a unigraph file with their articles loaded and an ontology pre-generated.
  - 2.  Doing further advanced queries over the semantic web to identify paths between entities, and concretize a network of information about times, places, people, works, etc.
  - 3.  Refining, typing/tagging, and annotating a curated research graph answering the original research question.
  - 4.  Sharing the data or analysis functions so others can use it.

- A teacher assigned readings to a class of students. Using Unigraph and the chrome extension (and eventually desktop plugin), students can comment or ask questions on specific sections. Everyone can read and respond to each other over the Unigraph layer, and these comment trees become a compounding asset that can be composed with other Unigraph artifacts.

- A data scientist who likes number theory decides to create a program to represent Lie Lattice projections. Unigraph gives them a toolkit to do even more with these projections, like making them interactive on the web.
