**Numerology** is a belief system that assigns symbolic meanings or mystical significance to numbers and numerical patterns.
It's **not a religion**, but it is often considered a **spiritual or metaphysical practice**.

- It involves studying the relationships between numbers and events, people, names, or even the cosmos.
- Practitioners believe that numbers carry inherent **vibrations or energies** that can reveal insights about personality, destiny, or life events.

Numerology is **not a religion**.
But it appears in **many spiritual traditions** and esoteric systems, such as:

- **Kabbalah** (Jewish mysticism)
- **Hinduism** (where numbers and astrology are interconnected)
- **Western occultism**, **New Age** beliefs, and **Theosophy**

Many people use it like astrology—for self-reflection, meaning-making, or entertainment.
It can be **spiritual**, but it's not inherently **religious** or tied to any one faith.
