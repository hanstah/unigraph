interspection is the entire gamut of inspecting, navigating, and interacting with information in Unigraph. people can use Unigraph to inter information. This means they can codify it in a standard language that allows it to be intered on in a unified application ecosystem. This can span from creating fun interactive stories, to complex linking annotation schemes across previously disparate data formats, or creating complex data science tools.
