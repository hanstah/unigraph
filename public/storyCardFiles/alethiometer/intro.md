**His Dark Materials** by Philip Pullman is a wonderful reflection on science, theology, and the human condition.

The protagonist is a girl named Lyra who has an incredible talent: a natural gift for reading  
an **alethiometer**—a rare and mysterious device that reveals the truth through a complex language of symbols.

Unlike scholars who spend decades deciphering its meanings through study, Lyra reads it intuitively, as if by instinct.

### Counting the features

**There are 36 symbols.**
Each symbol has multiple layers of meaning - typically 3 meanings per symbol, but advanced readers (like Lyra) can interpret many more.

**There are 4 needles.**
Three needles are set by the user to pose a question.
The fourth needle moves on its own to deliver the answer, pointing to a sequence of symbols.

The 3 large needles point to symbols to form a question.

## How hard is it to use?

##### Simple case

If the **3 needles are indistinguishable** (its only the set of symbols that matters), **repeats are allowed**, and there are 3 meanings (rigid) per symbol:

$$
36 \times 3 = 108 \quad \text{distinct symbol-meaning options}
$$

$$
\text{Total 'possible' questions} = \binom{108 + 3 - 1}{3} = \binom{110}{3} = 213,\!180
$$

$$
\text{Possible interpretations per 3-symbol combo} = 3^3 = 27
$$

##### Advanced case

In Lyra's world, she

If the **3 needles are distinguishable** (order matters), **repeats are allowed**, and there are 5 meanings (rigid) per symbol:

$$
36 \times 5 = 180 \quad \text{distinct symbol-meaning options}
$$

$$
\text{Total questions} = 180^3 = (36 \times 5)^3 = 5,\!832,\!000
$$

$$
\text{Possible interpretations per 3-symbol combo} = 5^3 = 125
$$

However, because each **needle has a unique semantic role**, even if the same symbol-meaning pair is selected, the interpretation differs depending on **which needle** selected it. That is:

- There are **3 × 180 = 540** atomic **meaning-role units** (symbol-meaning with needle-role context)
- Each question is a triple of **meaning-role units**, with needles in fixed positions

So the **full semantic space** of possible needle-role-aware interpretations is:

$$
\text{Total semantic interpretations} = 540^3 = (3 \times 180)^3 = 157,\!464,\!000
$$

### Interpretations per 3-symbol combination

$$
\text{Possible interpretations} = 3^3 = 27
$$

If the reader (e.g., Lyra) can perceive **multiple layers** or **combinations of meanings**, the total interpretations could be as high as the number of subsets of meanings:

$$
\text{Subset-based interpretations} = (2^3 - 1)^3 = 7^3 = 343
$$

_This assumes the reader may pick any non-empty subset of meanings for each symbol, combining them freely._

### Interpreting the Answer

The alethiometer is not just combinatorics — it's **semiotic** and **poetic**:

- Each response must be **read metaphorically**, drawing from the symbol’s layers.
- Lyra’s gift lies in **intuitive, almost subconscious interpretation** — akin to fluency in a language most others read mechanically.
