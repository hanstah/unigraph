## Axiomatic Systems and Primitives

**Foundations of geometry** is the study of [geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometries "Geometries") as [axiomatic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system"). There are several sets of axioms which give rise to [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") or to [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"). These are fundamental to the study and of historical importance, but there are a great many modern geometries that are not Euclidean which can be studied from this viewpoint. The term **axiomatic geometry** can be applied to any geometry that is developed from an axiom system, but is often used to mean Euclidean geometry studied from this point of view. The completeness and independence of general axiomatic systems are important mathematical considerations, but there are also issues to do with the teaching of geometry which come into play.

## Axiomatic systems

Main article: [Axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system")

Based on ancient Greek methods, an *axiomatic system* is a formal description of a way to establish the *mathematical truth* that flows from a fixed set of assumptions. Although applicable to any area of mathematics, geometry is the branch of elementary mathematics in which this method has most extensively been successfully applied.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#cite_note-1)

There are several components of an axiomatic system.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#cite_note-2)

1. **[Primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion")** (undefined terms) are the most basic ideas. Typically they include objects and relationships. In geometry, the objects are things like *points*, *lines* and *planes* while a fundamental relationship is that of *incidence* – of one object meeting or joining with another. The terms themselves are undefined. [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") once remarked that instead of points, lines and planes one might just as well talk of tables, chairs and beer mugs.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#cite_note-3) His point being that the primitive terms are just empty shells, place holders if you will, and have no intrinsic properties.
2. **[Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom")** (or postulates) are statements about these primitives; for example, *any two points are together incident with just one line* (i.e. that for any two points, there is just one line which passes through both of them). Axioms are assumed true, and not proven. They are the *building blocks* of geometric concepts, since they specify the properties that the primitives have.
3. The laws of **[logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic")**.
4. The **[theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem")**[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#cite_note-4) are the logical consequences of the axioms, that is, the statements that can be obtained from the axioms by using the laws of deductive logic.

An *interpretation* of an axiomatic system is some particular way of giving concrete meaning to the primitives of that system. If this association of meanings makes the axioms of the system true statements, then the interpretation is called a **model** of the system.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#cite_note-5) In a model, all the theorems of the system are automatically true statements.

### Properties of axiomatic systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foundations_of_geometry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Properties of axiomatic systems")]

In discussing axiomatic systems several properties are often focused on:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#cite_note-6)

- The axioms of an axiomatic system are said to be [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") if no logical contradiction can be derived from them. Except in the simplest systems, consistency is a difficult property to establish in an axiomatic system. On the other hand, if a [model](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(mathematical_logic)> "Model (mathematical logic)") exists for the axiomatic system, then any contradiction derivable in the system is also derivable in the model, and the axiomatic system is as consistent as any system in which the model belongs. This property (having a model) is referred to as *relative consistency* or *model consistency*.
- An axiom is called [independent](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(mathematical_logic)> "Independence (mathematical logic)") if it can not be proved or disproved from the other axioms of the axiomatic system. An axiomatic system is said to be independent if each of its axioms is independent. If a true statement is a [logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence") of an axiomatic system, then it will be a true statement in every model of that system. To prove that an axiom is independent of the remaining axioms of the system, it is sufficient to find two models of the remaining axioms, for which the axiom is a true statement in one and a false statement in the other. Independence is not always a desirable property from a pedagogical viewpoint.
- An axiomatic system is called [complete](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic)> "Completeness (logic)") if every statement expressible in the terms of the system is either provable or has a provable negation. Another way to state this is that no independent statement can be added to a complete axiomatic system which is consistent with axioms of that system.
- An axiomatic system is [categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_theory#History_and_motivation "Categorical theory") if any two models of the system are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") (essentially, there is only one model for the system). A categorical system is necessarily complete, but completeness does not imply categoricity. In some situations categoricity is not a desirable property, since categorical axiomatic systems can not be generalized. For instance, the value of the axiomatic system for [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory") is that it is not categorical, so proving a result in group theory means that the result is valid in all the different models for group theory and one doesn't have to reprove the result in each of the non-isomorphic models.

Near the beginning of the first book of the *Elements*, Euclid gives five [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate") (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry#cite_note-16)

"Let the following be postulated":

1. "To draw a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") from any [point](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)> "Point (geometry)") to any point."
2. "To produce [extend] a [finite straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") continuously in a straight line."
3. "To describe a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") with any centre and distance [radius]."
4. "That all right angles are equal to one another."
5. _The [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate")_: "That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles."

Although Euclid's statement of the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructions, they are also assumed to produce unique objects.

The success of the *Elements* is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are supposedly his. Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the *Elements*, encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The *Elements* still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.
