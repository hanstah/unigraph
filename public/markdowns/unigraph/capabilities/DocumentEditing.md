Unigraph has built-in Markdown and Rich-text editing with server-side storage.
Users can manage notes and file trees within their profile, and integrate their work into Unigraph's application ecosystem.

Access the Document Editor by going to the App Shell, and opening the view called "Document Editor". This will automatically load the files and folders saved to your current project. Files and folders can be created, renamed, deleted, and moved. Click on files in the tree to open the corresponding editor.
