# Tags and Types

Tags and types are separate attributes that can both be set on Entities.
Tags are flat sets of labels, and types are single-valued enumerations.
Developers can set as many custom attributes on Entities as they like, but Tags and Types are built-in to Unigraph's ecosystem to offer something flexible and functional out of the box.
