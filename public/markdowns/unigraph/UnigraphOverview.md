### Statements of Aims

Unigraph is a human-centric graph model engine, application library, and information platform.

Unigraph aims to be a general solution for web-based client-side interaction with Graphs.

Unigraph provides first-class mechanisms for managing display scenes independently from the underlying graph model, allowing for highly flexible and interactive representations of structured data.

Unigraph aims to provide a field-theoretical framework for graph-based applications and information exchange. Unigraph is both a developer library and a complete product.

Unigraph is a lightweight web-based data analytics application and bootstrap library.

Unigraph is an integration environment for various existing web-based tools, and can function as a dashboard tool to navigate and inspect high-dimensional data.

Aesgraph is an organization that serves an instance of Unigraph on the web.

### Product Statement

Unigraph is a tool to attack organizational complexity encountered in software engineering.
It aims to address challenges found in the creation, discovery, and management of information.
In theory, Unigraph should be able to fully represent a software system as a single graph object that can be interspected.

Unigraph offers:

- A framework for entity-based relational data modeling, view registration, and applet creation.
- A full layout system for arranging views and managing presets.
- User profiles, project management, and pre-built capabilities for graph-based analytics.

Unigraph has:

- 2D and 3D Graph Interspection Tools
- Table and Tree Views
- Code and Text-document Editor Tools
- A high-powered web ingestion and data annotation system
- LLM Copilot

### Definitions and Terms

**Interspection** is a single word to describe the interrelated actions of inspecting, navigating, and interacting with information in Unigraph. This term arises from the fact that Unigraph is built specifically for composing high-dimensional objects that cannot be reasoned about all at once.

**Synthropy** is an antonym of entropy, meaning structured emergence and synthesis. It is the process of reducing informational chaos, often through statistical reasoning or formal axiomatic structures.

**Particulated** is the property of being divisible and remixable into new structures.

### Composability

Unigraph uses composable architectures to promote distributed collaboration and synthropy.
It adheres to a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to maintain strict separation between data, behavior, and presentation.

**Data**
Entities, fundamental units of information, are structured into graphs using nodes, edges, tags, and types that reference each other by id. This makes Unigraph graph objects composable to arbitrary complexity, where their parts are divisible and reusable across organizational scopes.

**Display**
Unigraph provides first-class mechanisms for managing display scenes independently from the underlying graph model, allowing flexible customizations and multiple perspectives of the same underlying data that can be tailored to different needs and audiences.

**Application Development**
Unigraph implements an Entity Component System (ECS) that unifies data modeling, UI behavior, and state management under a single abstraction. New entity types, data, and application behaviors can be easily integrated into Unigraph using its Entity Component System.
