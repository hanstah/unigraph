### Data Primitives in the context of the Application User

A user has several resources they can manage within their account:

1. Projects
2. Files
3. Graphs
4. Annotations

A project can consist of many files, and a graph.
A file can be a .md, .txt, .pdf, .png, or .html document.
A graph is a collection of nodes and edges with ids, labels, and metadata like documents.
An annotation is a special type of metadata that can be attached to any resource.

A typical workflow for a user managing their walled internet garden would be:

1. Using the unigraph chrome extension to import information from the web into their Unigraph account.
   <insert image 1>
2. Opening a new project in Unigraph to arrange a selection of it and add a rich layer of metadata.
   <insert image 2>
