title: Unigraph Core
---

Unigraph is a walled-garden application ecosystem where users can create complex information objects using the following primitives:

- Documents (pdfs, markdowns, rich-text files, webpages, images, annotations)
- Graph structures (nodes, edges, graphs)
- Type-theoretic tools (tags, types)
- AI and Semantic Web Tools
- Application Views and Workspace Layouts

The application is designed to have a unified data model and context with which complex information objects and application behaviors can be constructed compositionally.
Unigraph also distinguishes itself by offering the most complete featureset of any open-source graph-based library or tool. <See more here>
This makes Unigraph an ideal bootstrapper for prototyping, iterating, and publishing objects that would not have a framework to exist otherwise.

Unigraph has the following views:

- Document Management
  - Markdown Viewer / Editor
  - PDF Viewer + Annotator (pdfjs)
  - Rich-text Editor (Lexical)

- Entity Management
  - Resource Manager

- Graph Visualization and Interaction Views
  - ReactFlow
  - ForceGraph3D

- Semantic Web Tools
  - Semantic Web Query Panel

- AI Tools
  - AI Chat

- Workspace Management
  - Workspace Layout Manager
  - Theme Selector
