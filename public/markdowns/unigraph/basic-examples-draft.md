One simple yet powerful utility of Unigraph is document reading, editing, annotating, and management.
With Unigraph, you can:

- write new rich-text or markdown files
- import pdfs, annotate them, and save them to a central store where you can access them later (all web based)
- link annotations across documents, creating a rich graph of relationships, and simplifying discovery
