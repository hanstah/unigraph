In the Unigraph codebase, a unigraph object is called a SceneGraph. The name was chosen to reflect the fact that it encompasses the display settings and application state of a graph, not just the model data.

Unigraph intends to be a first-class developer tool in the long term, but the sdk to construct scenegraphs is still in a prototype stage.
