**Unigraph**

Unigraph is a human-centric graph model engine, application library, and information exchange platform.
Unigraph is a general solution for web-based client-side interaction with Graphs.

Unigraph provides first-class mechanisms for managing display scenes independently from the underlying graph
model, allowing for highly flexible and interactive representations of structured data.
