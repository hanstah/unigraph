# Unigraph

Unigraph is a human-centric graph model engine, application library, and information exchange platform.

Unigraph is a general solution for web-based client-side interaction with Graphs. It aims to serve as a framework through which various independently developed graph-based applications can interoperate.

Unigraph provides first-class mechanisms for managing display scenes independently from the underlying graph
model, allowing for highly flexible and interactive representations of complex structured data.
